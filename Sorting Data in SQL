Sorting Data in SQL	

This project is using a CSV file for a list of movies. It contains data such as title, date released, director, wiki page descriptions, genre, and budget. I used BigQuery to do some basic sorting functions.

First, I queried the data and sorted it by Release_Date using the ORDER BY function.
SELECT *
FROM `movie_data.movies`
ORDER BY Release_Date

Then I filtered the query in a descending order using the DESC function. 
SELECT *
FROM `movie_data.movies`
ORDER BY Release_Date DESC

Then I added the WHERE clause to filter the query by the comedy genre.
SELECT *
FROM `movie_data.movies`
WHERE Genre = "Comedy"
ORDER BY Release_Date DESC

Lastly, I filtered the query by revenue using the AND function.
SELECT *
FROM `movie_data.movies`
WHERE Genre = "Comedy"
AND Revenue > 300000000
ORDER BY Release_Date DESC
