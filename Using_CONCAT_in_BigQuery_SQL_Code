For this query, I used open data from Citi Bike in BigQuery, which is a public bicycle sharing system in New York.
Then I used CONCAT to pull and concatenate data from different columns stored in the dataset.
I needed to create strings of recognizable route names that I could count and sort.
The information I needed was in the stations and trips table so I started building my query from there. 

SELECT
usertype,
CONCAT(start_station_name, " to ", end_station_name) AS route,
COUNT(*) as num_trips,
ROUND(AVG(CAST(tripduration AS int64)/60),2) AS duration
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
GROUP BY
start_station_name, end_station_name, usertype
ORDER BY
num_trips DESC
LIMIT 10


I also wanted to get the average trip duration for each route.
I didnâ€™t need the exact average, so I used the ROUND function to round it up.
I also needed to use the GROUP BY function to group together the summary rows.
And finally, I used the ORDER BY function to tell SQL how to organize this data.
I only wanted the top 10 results so I also added the LIMIT function as well.
